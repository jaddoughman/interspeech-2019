## Motivation
Current repository is used as an experiment evaluation system. Generated results are being used in a research inspired by following conference https://www.interspeech2019.org/.

## Dataset
To run code locally, you'll need a specific dataset as a starting point which can be found at [Ðšaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yoandinkov/youtubepoliticalbias). More information about dataset can be found in repository's [docs files](docs/dataset.md). There is an additional step of transforming dataset to a pickle instance which is explained [here](docs/environment_setup.md#environment-variables)

## Prerequisites
* Setup `python 3.7+`, `conda` on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Install environment via `conda env create yoandinkov/interspeech` or check it [here](https://anaconda.org/yoandinkov/interspeech)
* Set up `.env` file, information can be found [here](docs/environment_setup.md)
* Open `tests/` and run `python prerequisites.py` if no error messages are displayed, you are good to go

## Run experiments
* Open `src/` and run `python main.py` - there are default values so by only doing this code will be executed, however it's highly recommended to read [the experiment setup documentation](docs/experiment_setup.md) first.

## Feedback
* Any feedback is appreatied. For specific questions/code reviews new issues/PRs can be opened/created.
